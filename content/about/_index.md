Dance was my first love. It all began when I was little, grooving and jumping around to music on the radio. Noticing my enthusiasm, my parents enrolled me in ballet classes at our local community center. I would get dolled up in pink tights and leotards, and my mom would carefully put my hair into a bun, ready to plié and tendu my way through class.

As the years passed, my love for dance deepened, and my parents saw how serious I was about it. They enrolled me in a well-respected dance studio, CC & Company Dance Complex, where I worked my way up from recreational classes to the top competitive company. The training and discipline I received from my teachers shaped me into the dancer I am today. Their guidance strengthened my technique and movement quality—skills I still carry.

Eventually, I made one of the most challenging decisions of my life. I decided to step back from competitive dance and completely change the trajectory of my future. In the summer of 2023, I played the leading role in a musical at a local children’s theatre company. Taking on a major role was a welcome challenge that allowed me to embody a character and be someone different. The experience was exhilarating, and I realized that theatre was my second love. 

After that pivotal production, I gained the confidence to see that I was more than just a dancer—and that if I wanted to pursue theatre, I could. Determined to grow, I began taking voice and acting lessons, pushing myself to refine those skills to match my dance abilities. The hard work paid off. In April 2024, I was one of 20 student finalists chosen to participate in the DPAC Rising Star Awards. It was a HUGE accomplishment that validated my dedication to my craft. I am beyond grateful for that opportunity and the judges who saw my potential.

Never in a million years did I think I would accomplish as much as I have, yet here I am. I plan to continue doing theatre through college and eventually move on to something bigger—something beyond my wildest dreams. Though my journey has shifted unexpectedly, I wouldn’t change it for the world. Dance will always hold a special place in my heart, but theatre is my true passion. It is the love that I didn’t choose first, but the one that chose me.
